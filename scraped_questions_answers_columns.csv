"302. You have deployed a three-tier web application in a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/28. You initially deploy two web servers, two application servers, two database servers and one NAT instance tor a total of seven EC2 instances. The web, application and database servers are deployed across two Availability Zones (AZs). You also deploy an ELB in front of the two web servers, and use Route 53 for DNS Web.
