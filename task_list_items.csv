CloudFormation can never throw an error after launching a few services since it verifies all the steps before launching.
It will warn the user about the error and ask the user to manually create RDS.

"You can detach secondary (ethN) network interfaces when the instance is running or stopped. However, you can't detach the primary (eth0) interface."
"Launching an instance with multiple network interfaces automatically configures interfaces, private IP addresses, and route tables on the operating system of the instance."
"You can attach a network interface in one subnet to an instance in another subnet in the same VPC, however, both the network interface and the instance must reside in the same Availability Zone."
Attaching another network interface to an instance is a valid method to increase or double the network bandwidth to or from the dual-homed instance.
All of the things listed here.
Change security group membership for your instances while they're running.
Assign static private IP addresses to your instances that persist across starts and stops.
"Define network interfaces, and attach one or more network interfaces to your instances."

The EC2 instance follows the rules of the older subnet.
The EC2 instance follows the rules of both the subnets.
"Not possible, cannot be connected to 2 ENIs."
The EC2 instance follows the rules of the newer subnet.
AWS reserves the first and the last private IP address in each subnet's CIDR block so you do not have enough addresses left to launch all of the new EC2 instances.
"The Internet Gateway (IGW) of your VPC has scaled-up, adding more instances to handle the traffic spike, reducing the number of available private IP addresses for new instance launches."
"The ELB has scaled-up, adding more instances to handle the traffic spike, reducing the number of available private IP addresses for new instance launches."
AWS reserves one IP address in each subnet's CIDR block for Route 53 so you do not have enough addresses left to launch all of the new EC2 instances.
AWS reserves the first four and the last IP address in each subnet's CIDR block so you do not have enough addresses left to launch all of the new EC2 instances.
